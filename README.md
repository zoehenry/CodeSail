# CodeSail

Here is all of the work I created during CodeSail.  All of these files were made to practice different skills that we were learning throughout the bootcamp, as a result, many of them are a work in progress or are not as DRY as possible.  These files document my learning throughout the program.  If you would like to see my midterm and final project please look at my midterm_exercise repo and the Travel_App repo.
